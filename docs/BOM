QTY			Description

?           Vacuum cleaner motors

NOTE: You can use a shop vac as a very basic vacuum source, however for accurately testing higher 
flowing components you will ideally need to use a source that flows in excess of your target flow rate. 
The general choice is to use vacuum cleaner motors from salvaged vacuum cleaners. The number and style 
of vacuum cleaner motors will depend entirely on the application.

Vacuum cleaner motors can also be purchased from websites such as ali-express and ebay.
