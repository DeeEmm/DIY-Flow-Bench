1           Arduino - MEGA 2560
1           MAF Sensor - GM_LS2 (Part No. 92281162)

2           Ref pressure sensor MPXV7007DP -7 to + 7kPa (exactly +/- 28"/wg) (Optional but recommended)
1           Temp / Baro /Humidity correction - BME280 (Optional but recommended)
1           LCD KeyPad Shield (Optional)

1           DIYFB MEGA2560 Shield V1.0 (will be available from V2 onwards)

NOTE: 

- System will work with just a MAF and an Arduino. Control can be made via the serial monitor.
- If you want to run a pitot tube you will need 2 MPXV7007DP sensors - one for ref pressure and one for pitot

?           Vacuum cleaner motors

NOTE: You can use a shop vac as a very basic vacuum source, however for accurately testing higher 
flowing components you will ideally need to use a source that flows in excess of your target flow rate. 
The general choice is to use vacuum cleaner motors from salvaged vacuum cleaners. The number and style 
of vacuum cleaner motors will depend entirely on the application.

Vacuum cleaner motors can also be purchased from websites such as ali-express and ebay.
