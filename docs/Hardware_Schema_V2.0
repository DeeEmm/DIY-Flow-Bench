/***********************************************************
 * Hardware schema for V2
 *
 * NOTE: This code was developed to work on the DIYFB shield but can be adapted for use with other hardware.
 * 
 * The schema outlined below should help you to design your own shield or even just hook up sensors directly to
 * your ESP32 controller via breadboard or veroboard. The code is designed to take advantage of standard off-the-shelf
 * breakout boards that can easily be sourced via Tandy / Maplins / Radio Shack / Online / Wherever / Etc.
 *
 * However there are some caveats to be aware of...
 *
 * MAF and pressure sensors require 5v and so will not work when directly coupled to the ESP32 as it is a 3.3v device.
 * For this reason an ADC is used (ADS1115 recommended) however it will need to be supplied at 5v. This means that you will
 * need a 5v <> 3.3v logic level shifter to connect the I2C bus between the ADC1115 and the ESP32. As a result you will also 
 * need to integrate both 3.3v and 5v supplies. Buck style power supplies work well. (Make sure you tie the 0v Ref lines)
 *
 * The BME is a 3.3v device so you need to connect the BME's I2C bus to the ESP32 side of the I2C level shifter (3.3v side). 
 *
 * It should also be noted that not all Bosch BME breakout boards are built equally. There are many that claim to be BM[E]280's but are in fact BM[P]280's.
 * Note different 'E' and 'P' designations which refer to environment and pressure respectively. These boards are visually very similar but lack the Humidity 
 * measurement aspect. Many boards even have BME280 screen printed on them making it very hard to tell. BME / BMP control registers are identical except for 
 * the humidity control, so pressure and temperature code can be shared for both devices. The foot print is also shared, so many BOBs are used for both sensors.
 * My advice is to buy your BME280 from a reputable source as pretty much ALL of the cheaper non-branded units I sourced online turned out to be BMP280's 
 * If you get a chance to compare a BME and a BMP side-by-side yo will see that the BME is slightly squarer / larger (NOTE: we are only talking 0.2mm difference)
 *
 * There is also some (legacy) provision in the code for connecting analog sensors directly to the ESP32 within the code left over from V1 but this should largely
 * be considered redundant and the I2C connection schema used in preference. Discrete connections should work although are untested and may require code tweaks to
 * work with your chosen devices. Check the configuration for scaling and offset values. It should also be considered that using I2C does free up hardware pins to 
 * be utilised by other features / functions and it will massively simplify your design. Additionally future code versions will likely rely on free pin availability.

##  BME280 combined sensor (using I2C)
Datasheet - https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-bme280-breakout-hookup-guide/all

VCC - 3.3V !!!
GND - 0V
SDA - PIN 20 (Dedicated SCA pin for Mega2560)

/***********************************************************
* Pressure sensors 
*
* NOTE Preferred choice is NXP MPXV7007DP due to ideal scale / range. (+/- 28" AQ)
* All other NXP sensors have much larger range and so offer poor resolution
* MPXV7007DP is expensive but offers the best performance.
