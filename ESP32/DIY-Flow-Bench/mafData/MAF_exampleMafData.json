    The MAF lookup table takes the form of {key, value}

    Keys may represent analog units, volts, hertz, baked beans or or any other input value.
    Data table length is not fixed 
    Keys do not need to be contiguous nor linear
    Keys do not need to finish at a specific value
    Whatever value you input into the getMafRaw method will return the relevant lookup table value
    
    
    NOTE:
    Generally with analog sensor data the keys represent the sensor signal range and so are usually contiguous and to the order of bit^resolution.
    i.e. 10 bit data range has a table size of 2^10 = 1024 bits long, which means that there will be 1024 entries (as per this example).
    However, it should be noted that whilst the ESP32 inputs have 12 bit resolution, it is not necessary for the data table to share 
    this resolution. Lookup table results are interpolated and so input resolution does not need to match the lookup table size
    
    NOTE: that there should be a zero value!!!!
