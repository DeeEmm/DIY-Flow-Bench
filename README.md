General Version V2.0-RC.1

For current build version please check the BUILD_NUMBER in docs/changelog



## What is a Flow Bench?
###

A Flow Bench is a basic system to measure and display volumetric air flow.

It is used as a tool for measuring and quantifying modifications and improvements made to items like automotive cylinder heads and carburettors by measuring the amount of air that they can flow. By measuring the volume of air that can be passed through the item the user can determine if modifications help improve air flow characteristics.

Traditionally constructed of a manometer and calibrated flow orifices, volumetric flow was calculated using mathematical methods. Modern flow benches use sensors to detect flow and reference pressures, flow calculations are now undertaken by microprocessor.

## What is the DIY Flow Bench Project?
###

The DIY Flow Bench project (DIYFB) is a professional quality flow bench controller that produces results comparable with, and in some cases exceeding commercial grade systems. It uses high grade sensors and a WiFi enabled ESP32 microprocessor to display flow data and control bench operation via a web browser on any web enabled device. 

This repository contains the hardware schematics and software code needed to build a volumetric flow bench based on an ESP32 controller and commonly available automotive sensors.

Support is included for the following systems architectures.

- MAF based benches
- Orifice based benches
- Pitot style benches

The DIYFB system can be used on any flow bench and makes an ideal retrofit for older manometer based benches as well as being the perfect choice for new builds.


## Project Goals
###
- Validated software and hardware design.
- Affordable & easy to source components.
- Can be built & operated by a layman.
- Generates results comparable with commercial flow bench.
- Open source software and hardware design.


## Download
###

You can download the latest release from our [Githib repository](https://github.com/DeeEmm/DIY-Flow-Bench/releases)


## Development Info

This branch contains the current release candidate and is based on the ESP32 port of the original project.

After unit and peer testing is concluded and all bugs are resolved, this version will become the official DIYFB V2 release.

If you use this code and have found issues or have comments relating to the release, please raise an issue in the bugtracker.
