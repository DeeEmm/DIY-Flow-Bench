# DIY-Flow-Bench


This repository contains the hardware schematics and software code needed to build a volumetric flow bench based on an Arduino controller and common automotive MAF sensor


What is it?
===========

The DIY Flow Bench is a basic system to measure and display volumetric air flow.

The Flow Bench is used as a tool for measuring and quantifying modifications and improvements made to items such as automotive cylinder heads and carburettors by detecting air flow improvements.


Project Goals
=============

- Affordable & easy to source components.
- Can be built & operated by a layman.
- Generates results comparable with commercial flow bench.
- Open source.
