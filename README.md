For current build version please check the build number in the V1 repo - https://github.com/DeeEmm/DIY-Flow-Bench/tree/V1



## What is it?
###

The DIY Flow Bench is a basic system to measure and display volumetric air flow.

The Flow Bench is used as a tool for measuring and quantifying modifications and improvements made to items such as automotive cylinder heads and carburettors by detecting air flow improvements.

This repository contains the hardware schematics and software code needed to build a volumetric flow bench based on an Arduino controller and common automotive MAF sensor
