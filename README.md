# DIY-Flow-Bench

## Version Information
###

Version 1.0-Alpha

This repository contains the hardware schematics and software code needed to build a volumetric flow bench based on an Arduino controller and common automotive MAF sensor.

NOTE: This pre-release alpha version contains very basic code that you can use to display the output from your MAF on a simple display.

For more up to date releases and current development please check the Wiki / releases page


## What is it?
###

The DIY Flow Bench is a basic system to measure and display volumetric air flow.

The Flow Bench is used as a tool for measuring and quantifying modifications and improvements made to items such as automotive cylinder heads and carburettors by detecting air flow improvements.
