## PLEASE NOTE:

Please note that this version is soon to be superceded by the [ESP32 port](https://github.com/DeeEmm/DIY-Flow-Bench/tree/ESP32)

You can check progress on the ESP32 port in the [ESP32 Port Project](https://github.com/DeeEmm/DIY-Flow-Bench/projects/4)


## Version Information
###

General Version 1.0-Beta

For current build version please check the BUILD_NUMBER in  docs/changelog



## What is it?
###

The DIY Flow Bench is a basic system to measure and display volumetric air flow.

The Flow Bench is used as a tool for measuring and quantifying modifications and improvements made to items such as automotive cylinder heads and carburettors by detecting air flow improvements.

This repository contains the hardware schematics and software code needed to build a volumetric flow bench based on an Arduino controller and common automotive MAF sensor
