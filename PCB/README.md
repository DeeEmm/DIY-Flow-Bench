## BOM

__Notes:__
- The BOM below was automatically generated by EasyEDA and has not been validated (yet). 
- Only one type of pressure sensior is required for each channel - two types are listed (items 3 & 11) (MPXV7007DP is recommended)
- Mini blade fuse holder is for standard automotive blade fuses
- Wires can be soldered direct to board instead of using molex headers
- Parts are readily available and should able to be substituted with generic parts
