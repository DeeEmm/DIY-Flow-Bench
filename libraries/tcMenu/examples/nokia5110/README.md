## Adafruit_GFX Arduino menu example for 5110 buffered display

This is a very simple menu with an example of how to use tcmenu with a monochrome Adafruit_GFX buffered display. It simulates a lighting control system.

It demonstrates how to use tcmenu with the UIPEthernet library.

In order to connect using the Java API there are two possibilities, either use the connector UI that's shipped with TcMenu, or work with the tcMenu API directly. See [https://github.com/davetcc/tcMenu]

The files that are in this example:

* `remoteControlSerial.cpp` & `.h` are generated by the menu designer, they should not be edited, include the header file whenever you want to work with the menu items.
* `remoteControlSerial.ino` is the sketch, it will be modified by the designer as needed to add call back functions and required start up code.
* `remoteControlSerial.emf` open in the designer UI, used by the designer to store the menu structure. It is not needed at runtime, only for loading the design into the designer.
* `SerialTransport.cpp` and `.h` is the actual serial transport plug in that is copied by tcmenu into your project, do not edit is overwritten at next code generation.
* `tcMenuLiquidCrystal.cpp` and `.h` is the actual plugin for the display, do not edit will be overwritten at next code generation.
